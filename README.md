**Overview**

This repository focuses on Association Rule Mining, a fundamental technique in data mining for discovering interesting relationships and patterns between items in large datasets. Association rules are commonly used for tasks like market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and understanding customer behavior.

This project demonstrates the implementation of association rule mining using algorithms like Apriori, FP-Growth, and ECLAT. It provides an end-to-end pipeline, from data preprocessing to rule generation and evaluation.

**Key Features**

**Implementation of Popular Algorithms:**

- Apriori: Generates frequent itemsets and association rules.
- FP-Growth: Efficient frequent pattern generation for large datasets.
- ECLAT: Vertical data representation for fast rule mining.

**Configurable Rule Parameters:**

- Support, confidence, and lift thresholds for custom rule generation.

**Visualizations:**

- Plotting itemset frequencies.
- Visualizing relationships with network graphs.

**Real-World Use Cases:**

- Market basket analysis (e.g., product recommendations).
- Customer transaction analysis.
- Medical diagnosis pattern discovery.
